# Complexity Analyzer

Complexity Analyzer is a lightweight static analysis toolkit that reports
maintainability metrics for source files. It currently supports both Python and
Java code, producing:

* Source line counts (total, code, comment, blank, and docstring lines)
* Cyclomatic complexity totals (with per-function detail for Python)
* Halstead metrics (length, vocabulary, effort, estimated bugs, and more)
* Maintainability Index scores on a 0â€“100 scale

The library powers a simple command line interface so you can inspect metrics
quickly while developing.

## Installation

The package is intentionally self-contained. Clone the repository and install it
in editable mode if you want to use it as a dependency:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd complexity_analyzer
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, run the module directly without installation by pointing
`PYTHONPATH` at the project root.

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect the language from the file extension
python -m complexity_analyzer path/to/file.py

# Analyze a Java source file explicitly
python -m complexity_analyzer --language java path/to/Foo.java

# Emit JSON instead of the text report
python -m complexity_analyzer --format json path/to/file.py

# Include the Halstead operator/operand maps in the JSON payload
python -m complexity_analyzer --format json --show-operands path/to/file.java
```

The command exits with a non-zero status if the file cannot be located or the
language cannot be detected from the extension.

## Library Usage

You can import the core helpers to integrate the analyzer into your own tools:

```python
from complexity_analyzer import analyze_file, available_languages

print(available_languages())  # ['java', 'python']
metrics = analyze_file("src/example/Foo.java")
```

Each call returns a dictionary containing the metrics listed above. When using
JSON output from the CLI, the Halstead operator/operand frequency tables are
omitted by default to keep the payload concise. Pass `--show-operands` to retain
the detailed maps.

## Java Support

Java files benefit from the same metrics as Python. The analyzer performs basic
lexical tokenization to compute Halstead and cyclomatic complexity scores, while
the maintainability index is derived from those metrics and the effective source
lines of code. Per-method cyclomatic complexity is not currently reported for
Java because it would require a full parser, but the aggregate results match the
module-level reporting used by many tools.

## Development

Run the unit test suite with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Contributions that expand language support or improve the accuracy of the
metrics are welcome.
